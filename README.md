Machine Learning Major Project:

Topic: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Description:

The project involves building an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs). CNNs are widely used for image-related tasks and have achieved remarkable success in
various domains. This project will allow students to gain hands-on experience with deep
learning, image processing, and model development.
Steps:

1. Dataset Collection:
Gather a large dataset of labeled images relevant to the chosen domain or application. You can
explore publicly available datasets like CIFAR-10, ImageNet, or create your own dataset.

3. Data Preprocessing:
Preprocess the collected images by resizing them, normalizing pixel values, and splitting them
into training and testing sets.

5. CNN Model Architecture:
Design and implement a CNN architecture suitable for image classification. Consider popular
architectures like VGGNet, ResNet, or design your own architecture based on the problem
requirements.

7. Model Training:
Train the CNN model using the training dataset. Experiment with different hyperparameters,
such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer, to achieve better performance.

9. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset. Calculate metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

11. Model Optimization:
Fine-tune the model by applying techniques like data augmentation, regularization, or transfer
learning to further improve performance.

13. Deployment and Interface:
Build a user-friendly interface where users can input images, and the trained model will predict
the image class or category. You can use web frameworks like Flask or Django for this purpose.

8. Documentation and Presentation:
Document the project, including the dataset, preprocessing steps, model architecture, training
process, evaluation results, and deployment instructions. Prepare a presentation to showcase
the project's objectives, methodology, and outcomes.
